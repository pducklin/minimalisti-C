This is the Tiny C Compiler, originally created by the talented and absurdly
productive French programmer Fabrice Bellard. Fabrice is the originator of
many very widely-used projects, including FFMPEG, QEMU, QuickJS, and more.

He's also a leading figure in the algorithms we use today for calculating
the decimal expansion of pi (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to
its diameter) efficiently to absurd numbers of digits, because every 
brilliant programmer needs a relaxing hobby :-)

This repository has been stripped down heavily, and lightly modified, for 
use as a learning tool on 64-bit Windows. It makes a miniature but useful
development kit for hackers and cybersecurity threat researchers that is
less that 1/10,000th the installed size of tools such as MINGW64 or Microsoft 
Visual Studio, even with its source archive included. It can be built on 
Linux if you have clang or gcc installed, which produces a handy miniature 
cross-compiler for Linux, as well as a full Windows binary distro *and* 
source tree archive weighing in at about 1MB for everything. (Yes, 1MB, not 
1GB. And, yes, it can compile itself out of the box on Windows. Builds are 
not time-stamped so they are repeatable. The distro includes self-build 
scripts with embedded hashes so you can check that it's working correctly.)

The only file you actually *need* to make working Windows test code, 
including BootExecute binaries, kernel drivers, EXEs, DLLs and UEFI apps
is the .EXE of the compiler itself, which is under 500KB. 

The project started life as a compiler for a usable subset of C that was 
small enough to win the Obfuscated C contest. (True story!) 

Inventor Fabrice then turned it into a proper C compiler + linker + runtime 
library, and included code from numerous contributors to support a wide range 
of target processors, forming the aptly-named TCC, short for Tiny C Compiler.

At one time, it seems that the project as a whole used the the GNU Lesser 
GPL 2.1 licence, but Fabrice ultimately asked the known contributors to 
relicense their files under an MIT-style licence. One author explictly 
declined to relicense one of their files, while two other authors responsible 
for three files in total did not respond. None of those unrelicensed files 
appear in this project, which was created, modified and tweaked by Paul
Ducklin. My contributions are licensed under these same MIT-style conditions
requested by Fabrice.

However, some files used here seem to have been taken from GCC, such as code
to support the Elf/STAB formats that the Tiny C Compiler uses, even on the
Windows platform. (Object files that would be .OBJs with other compilers are
actually .o files, and .LIBs come out as .a files, which are Unix-style 'ar'
archives. For source debugging, you can therefore use a Windows port of GDB,
of which several are available.)

The GNU Library Public License, version 2, and its successor the GNU Lesser 
General Public License 2.1, therefore applies to some code here.

Enjoy.

PS. If the word "licence" seems weird to you, keep in mind that in British 
and Commonwealth English, we use -C- in its noun forms, and -S- in its verb 
forms, so we follow licensing procedures to create and issue licences. 
Americans use the -S- spelling for both. We do the same thing with the word 
"practice," so that cricket practice is time used to practise cricket. 
Amusingly, Americans have chosen the -C- spelling for both of those forms. 
Also, they tend to go in for baseball rather than cricket, but that is a
matter for another day.
